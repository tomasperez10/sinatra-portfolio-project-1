# Sinatra Portfolio Project: Favorite Video Games

## About

Welcome to my Sinatra ActiveRecord CRUD project! In this repository, you will find a Sinatra app built with ActiveRecord, that directs you to a website where you can login as a User and store/post information on your favorite video games. If you do not have an account in the database, you must sign up. Once you sign up, you will be directed to the login page. If you login with the correct credentials, you will be directed to your wall, where it lists/reads the favorite video games that you have posted. Once you are on your wall, there are several options that you can choose from. At the bottom of your wall, you will see a logout route that brings you back to the home page where you login or sign up. Further up on the wall page, you have an option to click on a route that allows you to create/post a new favorite video game to your wall. Once the route is clicked on, simply write down your favorite video game and submit. There's also a click option to route back to the wall. Finally, if you click on any of your favorite video games on your wall, where each video game has a route, you will have an option to click on a route to delete the video game, edit the video game, or go back to the wall. If you select the delete option, you will be redirected to your wall, with the video game that was deleted missing from your wall. If you select the edit option, you will be directed to an edit page where you can adjust what you said about the video game and redirect back to the wall with the newly edited video game on it once submitted. On the edit page, you can also have the option to click and route back to the edit/delete selection page for that specific video game, or you can click and route back to the wall.
